Redis::Mutex

A Redis-backed mutex that is a (almost 100%) complete drop-in for the Mutex class
found in Ruby's standard library.

Differences:
- Redis::Mutex#synchronize raises ArgumentError instead of ThreadError if no block
  is passed.
- Redis::Mutex#unlock does not raise ThreadError if the lock hasn't been acquired.
- Redis::Mutex#unlock returns a boolean instead of self.

Plus, Redis::Mutex#refresh is available to renew the expiration of an acquired lock.
